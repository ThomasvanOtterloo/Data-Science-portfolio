    "The task of a data scientist is to extract insights and knowledge from data, which can be used to inform business decisions, solve problems, and optimize processes. This involves using a variety of analytical and statistical techniques to explore and manipulate data, and then using that data to develop predictive models or other solutions that can be applied to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a data scientist might create a decision tree to predict which category something fits into. Alternatively, they might use machine learning to predict which products a customer is likely to buy after purchasing a specific item. These predictive models are just one way that data scientists can provide valuable insights to clients or stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective communication is also a critical part of the data scientist's role. They must be able to explain their findings and insights to a variety of audiences, including executives, managers, and other team members. This requires strong communication skills, as well as the ability to translate technical concepts into plain language that non-technical stakeholders can understand."

By graphing the body mass with the sex attribute, i can now easily read which sex in generally more heavy. With these readings i can investigate more and more about the pengiun data set and deliver more information to the client hoping to fix some problems."
